            <p>
                Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (1931–2015), known as the "Missile Man of India", was a visionary scientist and the 11th President of India. Born in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he rose from humble beginnings to lead major scientific missions like India’s satellite launch vehicle and the Pokhran-II nuclear tests. As President (2002–2007), he was widely loved as the “People’s President”, inspiring millions with his humility, wisdom, and deep dedication to education and national development. Even after his presidency, he continued to motivate students through his speeches and books like <em>Wings of Fire</em>. He passed away while delivering a lecture, leaving behind a legacy of dreams, determination, and service to the nation.
